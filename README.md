## Project Requirements
 
This is an engineering proof of concept. The goal is to exercise the Spring MVC/Boots technology according to “company” guidelines to validate its use in future projects. 
A group consists of 3~4 members. 
 
While during project, you have conflicts with team members. Please solve by yourselves, try your best not come to me. Teamwork is important during project. 
The main hours spent on the project for each person is expected to be ~50(?) hours. Every Team member is to “own” a “front to back” scenario - View, Controller, Domain Object, Validation, Service and Repository.

###### Here is the list of the techniques you must include in your project as a Group.

Technique 
XML config/Java Config 	✓
PRG 	
JSP, Thymeleaf 	✓
Bean Validation or Spring Validator 	✓
Custom Validation Annotation 	
Custom Formatter 	
Uploading files 	✓
Exception Handling (Individual, Globally) 	✓
REST/Ajax – Error Handling 	 
Spring Security (Database, Logout, Remember Me, csrf, etc) 	✓
Security authorization – interceptor, AOP 	✓
Persistence – Hibernate + Spring Data 	✓
ONLY allow In memory database (H2, HSQL, etc) 	✓

It means your project must include those techniques which are checked 
What kind of project should I develop? Here is the variety of options you can choose: 
 
➢	Spring MVC monolith 
➢	Spring MVC monolith Thymeleaf 
➢	Spring REST: Client (JSP) + Server 
➢	Spring REST: Client (Thymeleaf) + Server 
➢	Spring boot monolith JSP 
➢	Spring Boot: Client(JSP) + Server 
➢	Spring Boot monolith Thymeleaf 
➢	Spring Boot: Client(Thymeleaf) + Server 
If you need to use a new technique which isn’t covered in this course, you must get permission first. Otherwise, you’re gonna lose points in your group project grade.
